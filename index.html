            This article is about the basketball team. For the American football
            team, see Chicago Bulls (AFL) The Chicago Bulls are an American
            professional basketball team based in Chicago. The Bulls compete in
            the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the
            league's Eastern Conference Central Division.[9] The team was
            founded on January 16, 1966, and played its first game during the
            1966–67 NBA season.[1] The Bulls play their home games at the United
            Center, an arena on Chicago's West Side. The Bulls saw their
            greatest success during the 1990s when they played a major part in
            popularizing the NBA worldwide. They are known for having one of the
            NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between 1991
            and 1998 with two three-peats. All six of their championship teams
            were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and coach
            Phil Jackson. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple
            championships while never losing an NBA Finals series in their
            history.[10] The Bulls won 72 games during the 1995–96 season,
            setting an NBA record that stood until the Golden State Warriors won
            73 games during the 2015–16 season. The Bulls were the first team in
            NBA history to win 70 games or more in a single season, and the only
            NBA franchise to do so until the 2015–16 Warriors.[11] Since 1998,
            the Bulls have failed to regain their former success. The franchise
            struggled throughout the 2000s, but showed promise in the early
            2010s, led by Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, culminating in
            back-to-back seasons above .732 in 2010–11 and 2011-12. However, due
            to injuries to and departures of key players, the franchise was
            never able to build on that success and has sunk back into
            mediocrity since. Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose have both won the
            NBA Most Valuable Player Award while playing for the Bulls, for a
            total of six MVP awards. The Bulls share rivalries with the
            Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat and the New York
            Knicks. The Bulls' rivalry with the Pistons was highlighted heavily
            during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Outside of basketball, the
            Chicago Bulls are also known for their community work through their
            charity department which provides youth and non-for-profit
            organizations with tickets to games and merchandise.
